   - Token to vector conversion
   - Positional encoding addition

2. **Multi-Head Self-Attention**
   - Query, Key, Value transformations
   - Attention score calculation
   - Multiple attention heads

3. **Layer Normalization & Residual Connections**
   - Normalization process
   - Skip connections

4. **Feed-Forward Network**
   - Two linear transformations
   - ReLU activation

5. **Final Layer & Output**
   - Final normalization
   - Vocabulary projection
   - Softmax probability distribution
